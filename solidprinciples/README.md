S - Single Responsibility Principle

O - Open/Closed Principle

L - Liskov Substitution Principle

I - Interface Segmented Principle

D - Dependency Inversion Principle


## Advantages of these principles
Helps us to write better code:
- Avoid duplicate code
- Easy to maintain
- Easy to understand
- Flexible software
- Reduce Complexity

### Single Responsibility Principle 
A class should have only 1 reason to change (Refer singleresponsibility.SingleResponsibilityPrinciple.java)

### Open/Closed Principle
Open for extension but closed for modification (Refer openclosed.OpenClosedPrinciple.java)

### Liskov Substitution Principle
If class B is subtype of class A, then we should be able to replace object of A without breaking the behaviour of the
program

Subclass should extend the capability of parent class instead of narrowing it down (Refer LiskovSubstitution.java)

### Interface Segmented Principle
Interfaces should be such, that client shouldn't implement unnecessary functions they do not need (Refer
InterfaceSegmentedPrinciple.java)

### Dependency Inversion Principle
Class should depend on interfaces rather than concrete classes (Refer DependencyInversionPrinciple.java)
